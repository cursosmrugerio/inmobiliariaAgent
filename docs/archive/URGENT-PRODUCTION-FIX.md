# üö® URGENT: Production CI/CD Fix Required

## TL;DR - What You Need to Do

Your GitHub Actions workflow is **missing the frontend build step**. This has been fixed, but you need to commit and push the changes.

### Quick Action (5 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/mike/Desarrollo/compyser/inmobiliaria/backend

# 1. Remove committed build artifacts from Git
git rm -r --cached src/main/resources/static/

# 2. Commit all changes (workflow + gitignore + removed artifacts)
git add .github/workflows/deploy-cloud-run.yml
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add automated frontend build to CI/CD pipeline

- Add Node.js setup and frontend build to deploy workflow
- Build frontend automatically before Docker build
- Add src/main/resources/static/ to .gitignore
- Remove committed frontend build artifacts

Frontend changes will now deploy automatically to production."

# 3. Push to GitHub (triggers deployment)
git push origin main
```

**That's it!** GitHub Actions will now automatically build your frontend on every push.

## What Was Wrong

### Before (Current Production)
```
Your workflow:
1. ‚ùå Checkout code
2. ‚ùå Build backend only (mvn package)
3. ‚ùå Build Docker (with whatever static files were committed)
4. ‚ùå Deploy to Cloud Run

Problem: Frontend files are manually built and committed.
Result: Frontend changes don't deploy automatically.
```

### After (Fixed)
```
New workflow:
1. ‚úÖ Checkout code
2. ‚úÖ Set up Node.js 20
3. ‚úÖ Build frontend (npm ci && npm run build)
4. ‚úÖ Build backend (includes fresh frontend)
5. ‚úÖ Build Docker
6. ‚úÖ Deploy to Cloud Run

Benefit: Frontend builds automatically on every push!
```

## Files Changed

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy-cloud-run.yml`** - Added frontend build step
2. **`.gitignore`** - Added `src/main/resources/static/` to ignore build artifacts

---

## After You Push

Monitor your deployment:

```bash
# Watch GitHub Actions
# https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO/actions

# Or watch Cloud Run
gcloud run services logs read inmobiliaria-api --region=us-central1 --follow
```

The first deployment will build the frontend fresh (may take 1-2 minutes longer).

---

## Future Changes

**No more manual builds!** Just:

```bash
# 1. Make frontend changes
vim frontend/src/App.tsx

# 2. Commit and push
git add frontend/
git commit -m "Update frontend"
git push

# GitHub Actions builds and deploys automatically!
```
