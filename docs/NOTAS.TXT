  Option 4: Rebuild Frontend (If above doesn't work)

  If the cache is really stubborn, rebuild the frontend:

  cd frontend
  npm run build

  Then do a hard refresh in your browser.

Problem Identified

  You were right to question the initial test! The issue was that the Vite dev server 
  needed to be restarted to pick up the file changes. The browser cache wasn't the issue
  - it was the dev server not hot-reloading the changes.

- Re-launched the frontend Vite dev server with nohup npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173, writing logs to /tmp/vite-
    dev.log; it now advertises http://localhost:5173/.

To execute that command from your terminal, you have a few options depending on what you want to
   achieve:

  Option 1: Basic execution (blocks terminal)

  npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173

  Option 2: With nohup (runs in background, survives terminal close)

  nohup npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173 > dev.log 2>&1 &

  This will:
  - Run the process in the background (&)
  - Redirect output to dev.log instead of the terminal
  - Continue running even if you close the terminal
  - Store the process ID so you can kill it later with kill <PID>

  Option 3: View output in real-time with nohup

  nohup npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173 > dev.log 2>&1 & tail -f dev.log

  This runs in background but lets you see the logs with tail -f.

  To stop a nohup process later:

  # Find the process
  lsof -i :5173

  # Or
  ps aux | grep "npm run dev"

  # Then kill it
  kill <PID>

  Note: Make sure you're in the frontend directory before running these commands. If you're
  currently in /Users/mike/Desarrollo/compyser/inmobiliaria/backend, you'll need to navigate to
  the frontend directory first:

  cd ../frontend
  nohup npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173 > dev.log 2>&1 &
