Problem Identified

  You were right to question the initial test! The issue was that the Vite dev server 
  needed to be restarted to pick up the file changes. The browser cache wasn't the issue
  - it was the dev server not hot-reloading the changes.

- Re-launched the frontend Vite dev server with nohup npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173, writing logs to /tmp/vite-
    dev.log; it now advertises http://localhost:5173/.
